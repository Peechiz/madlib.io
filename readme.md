# Madlib.io

For my Q1 project I'd like to make a Madlib generator.

### Goals
* User can paste in any huge block of words
* Any word can be wildcarded
* Wildcards aill output a shareable form
* The form will output a finished Madlib.

##### In order to do this, I plan to use the following libaries and APIs:

* [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) for buttons
* [Wordnik API](https://www.wordnik.com/) to query part of speech
* [Bounce.js](http://bouncejs.com/) for squirrelly fun bits, and fun animations
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) because it was mandated.
